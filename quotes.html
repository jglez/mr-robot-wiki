  <blockquote>
    <cite>“It's one thing to question your mind; it's another to question your eyes and ears. But, then again, isn't
      it all the
      same? Our senses just mediocre inputs to our brain? Sure, we rely on them, trust they accurately portray the real
      world
      around us, but what if the haunting truth is they can't? That what we perceive isn't the real world at all, but
      just
      our
      mind's best guess? That all we really have is a garbled reality, a truly fuzzy picture we will never make out?”
