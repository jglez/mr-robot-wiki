            <p>Mr. Robot follows Elliot Alderson, a young cybersecurity engineer living in New York City, where he works at the cybersecurity agency Allsafe. Elliot constantly struggles with social anxiety, clinical depression, and dissociative identity disorder. Elliot's thoughts seem heavily affected by paranoia and delusion.<br><br></p>

            <p>Elliot's way of connecting with people is by hacking them, which often leads him to act as a cyber-vigilante. He is recruited by a mysterious figure known only as Mr. Robot who leads a hacktivist group called fsociety. Their biggest mission is to cancel all consumer debt by encrypting the data of one of the largest corporations in the world, E Corp, which Elliot perceives as Evil Corp.</p>
